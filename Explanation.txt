Given an array A, partition it into two subarrays left and right,
Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
left and right are non-empty.
left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

Input Description:
n length of the array, in next line,
n elements os array
(1<n<1000)

Output Description:
the length of left after such a partitioning

Sample Input:
5
3 5 0 6 7

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
left =(3,5,0)
so the length is 3
